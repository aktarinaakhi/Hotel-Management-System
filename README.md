# Chapter 1 Introduction	 

## 1.1 Introduction

In my project “Hotel Management System” we have tried to show how the data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. It manages and maintains the records of customers, rooms, employees and drivers in the hotel. The project is aimed to maintain the day-to-day state of admission/vacation of Residents, List of employees, room details etc. Main objective of this project is to provide a solution for hotels to manage most their work using computerized processes.
This software application will help admin to handle customer information, room allocation details, Payment details etc. The rooms have different categories like single bed, double bed etc. So their charges and records will be maintained accordingly. This software has been made in a user friendly interface, so that anyone can add, delete, update the entries and handle all the transactions easily. As a security we have provided Admin username and Password.
The project, Hotel Management System is a desktop-based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various rooms, employees, drivers and customers make this system very flexible and convenient. This application gives managers the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online system. Hotel management project provides room booking, staff management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system.


## 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional hotel management does not include all functions, such as the location of the consumer, the amount of payment for the reservation, and what they are doing right now. Additionally, most hotels were experiencing a lot of issues affecting their reliability, performance, efficiency, and effectiveness.


## 1.3 Objective

The objective of the Hotel Management System is to develop a project which maintains booking of rooms, providing drivers, etc. It is a windows based application to be implemented by Java.
The Purpose of the whole process is to ease the daily or regular activities of the Hotel Management into an automatic computerized retrievable process. The daily activities include the Room activities, Entering details of the new customer check in, To allocate a room as per the customer need and interest, Recording the checkout time and details, Releasing or Empty of room and to record the process in a computer system for future.
Main objective of this project is to provide a solution for hotels to manage most their work using computerized processes. This software application will help admin to handle customer information, room allocation details, Payment details etc.

•	Keeping records of admission of customers.
•	Facilities provided by hotels are fully utilized in an effective and efficient manner.


## 1.4 Feature

•	Hotel Room Bookings and Reservation
•	Front Desk Operations
•	Managing Guest Profile
•	User Privilege and security control
•	Keeping a tab on guest check-in check-out status
•	Maintenance of hotel rooms.
•	Providing a user friendly interface.

Administrative Modules
 
There are 2 modules we have included in this project :

1.	Admin : Admin can add a new room , a new employee and a new driver.

2.	Receptionist : Receptionist can add a new customer and allocate rooms, can check all room details, customers details, employee details, search for a particular room etc.


## 1.5 Project Objectives

Main objective of this project is to provide solution for hotel to manage most there work using computerized process. This software application will help admin to handle customer information, room allocation details, Payment details etc.
•	Keeping records of admission of customers.
•	Facilities provided by Hotel are fully utilized in effective and efficient manner. 


## 1.6 Motivations

Analog management system is very complex for human and it also time consuming. Most of the time occur mistake. So a management system is needed for handling overall management. Such type of management system is the hotel management system. Few months ago our university arranged a county tour and   we visited in Rangamati sakej and stayed at hotel paradise. We were total around 40 students are attended in the tour. One night we were going to paradise hotel for booking a room. That time we saw that the hotel member was booking hotel in analog system and the hotel manager confirm to call the hotel Client if the room is available or not. If the room is available that time he also need to know room condition is dirty or clean. After confirming all kinds of the requirement the hotel manager provided a room for us. That time we motivate to built a management system. To that end we have created this "Hotel Management System" computer application.


## 1.7 Existing System

In the existing manual system a lot of time is spent in communicating the information across different branches. There is a need for an automated system, which has some centralized control over the entire process. Conventional System makes use of huge amounts of paper for recording transactions. All the Hotel records are to be maintained for the details of each customer, Fee details, Room Allocation etc.
Disadvantages:
•	Time consuming
•	Inaccuracy of data


## 1.8 Proposed System:

Proposed system is the computerized version of the existing system which provides easy and quick access over the data. Keeping the records of admission of Resident properly so that facilities provided by Hotels are fully utilized in effective and efficient manner.
Advantages:
•	Less Time consuming
•	Maintain accuracy

Hotel Management Software is programmed to enable HR professionals for managing the data and information of the company’s employees on a regular basis. The easy information regarding the employees is including contact details, investment details, and much more.
Accuracy: Our system must be able to accommodate our employees and various customers or guests at our hotel. Once a good system is in place, we will have an accurate record of the check-in and check-out status of a customer. An automated system minimizes the possibility of human error, as the only real factor is whether employees remember to clock in and out.
 Record-Keeping: Another feature of a hotel management system is that it can be used to keep detailed and accurate records. These records can be stored in a main database on site, online or in an outside record-keeping facility.
Record-keeping can help us monitor trends such as how much overtime we're paying and how many employees participate in our company retirement plans.

#Chapter 3 Theoretical Background  

## 3.1 Java swing 

Java Swing tutorial is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in Java. Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components. The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as jbutton, jtextfield, jtextarea, jradiobutton, jcheckbox, jmenu, jcolorchooser etc.
Hierarchy of Java Swing classes
The hierarchy of java swing API is given below.


### 3.1.2 Java Swing Examples

There are two ways to create a frame: By creating the object of Frame class (association) by extending the Frame class (inheritance). We can write the code of swing inside the main(), constructor or any other method.
Different type of swing component that we are using our project
•	Jbutton class
•	Jradiobutton class
•	Jtextarea class
•	Jcombobox class
•	Jtable class
•	Jcolorchooser class
•	Jprogressbar class
•	Jslider class
•	Digital Watch
•	Graphics in swing
•	Displaying image
•	Edit menu code for Notepad
•	Opendialog Box
•	Notepad
•	Puzzle Game
•	Pic Puzzle Game
•	Tic Tac Toe Game
•	BorderLayout
•	Grid layout
•	Flowlayout
•	Cardlayout

## 3.2 XAMPP software:

XAMPP is one of the widely used cross-platform web servers, which helps developers to create and test their programs on a local webserver. It was developed by Apache Friends, and its native source code can be revised or modified by the audience. It consists of Apache HTTP Server, mariadb, and interpreter for the different programming languages like PHP and Perl. It is available in 11 languages and supported by different platforms such as the IA-32 package of Windows & x64 package of macos and Linux.
XAMPP helps a local host or server to test its website and clients via computers and laptops before releasing it to the main server. It is a platform that furnishes a suitable environment to test and verify the working of projects based on Apache, Perl, mysql database, and PHP through the system of the host itself. Among these technologies, Perl is a programming language used for web development, PHP is a backend scripting language, and mariadb is the most vividly used database developed by mysql.

### 3.2.1 Components of XAMPP
As defined earlier, XAMPP is used to symbolize the classification of solutions for different technologies. It provides a base for testing of projects based on different technologies through a personal server. XAMPP is an abbreviated form of each alphabet representing each of its major components. This collection of software contains a web server named Apache, a database management system named mariadb and scripting/ programming languages such as PHP and Perl. X denotes Cross-platform, which means that it can work on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macos.

Many other components are also part of this collection of software and are explained below.
•	Apache: It is an HTTP a cross-platform web server. It is used worldwide for delivering web content. The server application has made free for installation and used for the community of developers under the aegis of Apache Software Foundation. The remote server of Apache delivers the requested files, images, and other documents to the user.
•	Phpmyadmin: It is a tool used for dealing with mariadb. Its version 4.0.4 is currently being used in XAMPP. Administration of DBMS is its main role.
•	XAMPP Control Panel: It is a panel that helps to operate and regulate upon other components of the XAMPP. Version 3.2.1 is the most recent update. A detailed description of the control panel will be done in the next section of the tutorial.


## 3.3 MySQL data base
  
Mysql is a relational database management system based on the Structured Query Language, which is the popular language for accessing and managing the records in the database. Mysql is open-source and free software under the GNU license. It is supported by Oracle Company.
It is very important to understand the database before learning mysql. A database is an application that stores an organized collection of records. It can be accessed and managed by the user very easily. It allows us to organize data into tables, rows, columns, and indexes to find the relevant information very quickly. Each database contains a distinct API for performing database operations such as creating, managing, accessing, and searching the data it stores. Today, many databases are available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. 

###3.3.1 Working procedure of MySQL
MySQL follows the working of Client-Server Architecture. This model is designed for the end-users called clients to access the resources from a central computer known as a server using network services. Here, the clients make requests through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the server will give the desired output as soon as the instructions are matched. The process of MySQL environment is the same as the client-server model.


## 3.4 SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc. SQL is not a database system, but it is a query language.


### 3.4.1 Process of SQL

When we are executing the command of SQL on any Relational database management system, then the system automatically finds the best routine to carry out our request, and the SQL engine determines how to interpret that particular command.
Structured Query Language contains the following four components in its process:
•	Query Dispatcher
•	Optimization Engines
•	Classic Query Engine
•	SQL Query Engine, etc.
A classic query engine allows data professionals and users to maintain non-SQL queries. The architecture of SQL is shown in the following diagram:

#Chapter 04 Implementation and Methodology


## 4.1 Methodology

To implement our management, we followed Incremental development model. Incremental development in some form is now the most common approach for the development of application systems and software products. This approach can be either plan-driven, agile or, more usually, a mixture of these approaches. The benefits of this model is to change during the development process. This is the case for most business systems and software products.

•	Implementation cost is reduced and the documentation is less.
•	Easy to get customer feedback and Customers can comment on demonstrations of the software and see how much has been implemented.
•	Early delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible.

## 4.2 system development life cycle (SDLC)

The system development life cycle, purpose of this article is to develop an understanding of the system development lifecycle and its role in managing the development of digital library systems. It is very important in developing a project.

There is a different model of this System Development Life cycle that helped the proponents; one of them is the spiral model that helped the step-by-step procedure of this system.


## 4.3 Market or Industry Adaptability

Nowadays, the hotel business has become very popular all over the world. Businessman sells their product through online to reach the maximum number of customers than the offline sell in a hotel. So, to sell the room on an application is needed to maintain and organize the system. That’s why, a hotel management system application needs to be implemented for those businessman to sell their room and get payment in a proper way. As a result, hotel management application software demand rapidly increasing day by day.

•	Easy to use for all types of retailers.
•	Maintains room, driver any time.
•	Real-time database system.

##4.4 Overall functional components of the hotel management system
